    'Grand Canyon West Rim Tour',
    'Grand Canyon West Rim is a fascinating tourist attraction site for camping',
    'The region know as Big Sur is like Yosemite''s younger cousin, with all the redwood scaling, rock climbing and, best of all, hiking that the larger park has to offer.

Take a tranquil walk to the coastal waterfall at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Par or hike to the Married Redwoods. If you''re prepared for a more strenuous climb, try Ollason''s Peak in Toro Park. An optional 4th day includes admission to the Henry Miller Library and the Point Reyes Lighthouse.',
